Description: Image processing toolkit for registration and segmentation - examples
 ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and
 segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and
 classifying data found in a digitally sampled
 representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image
 acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI
 scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
 correspondences between data. For example, in the medical
 environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to
 combine the information contained in both.
 .
 This package contains the source for example programs.

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, documentation
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package contains all documentation (extensive).
