Description: seamless operability between C++11 and Python
 pybind11 is a lightweight header library that exposes C++ types in
 Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++
 code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python
 library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional
 extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time
 introspection.
 .
 This package provides the header-only library.
